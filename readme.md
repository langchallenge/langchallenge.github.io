#  LangChallenge

LangChallenge is an enthralling initiative to foster more interest and to add some thrill to the coding experience among coding enthusiasts and amateur coders. It is a 2-day event. Both teams and individuals may participate in this challenge. A team must have 2-3 members. 

Each team will be allotted a new programming language (which will be an uncommon one). The participants will be required to learn the new language within the allotted time. Using the programming language assigned to them, the participants will also complete a set of problems worth 100 points each. The tasks will include some basic programming questions and application-based programs. The participants will be required to put their solutions to the problems on GitHub. A small workshop will be conducted to introduce the participants to the usage of GitHub in case they are not familiar with it. On the final day, there will be a final presentation near the swimming pool. A cash prize and goodies will be awarded to the winner.

The main objective of this challenge will be to test the ability of a person to learn something new, use what they learn to solve real world application problems, and encourage the youth to hone their ability in learning new skills faster.  

## LangChallenge is part of CSIS'18

The Computer Society India Symposium (CSIS) is a flagship event of the IEEE Computer Society India SAC and is held annually with the venue being rotated among the various sections of India. The main scope of this symposium is to bring professionals, speakers, experts, and other academicians together so the participants can interact and, in the process, learn. The symposium is generally a 3-day event. It includes talks, workshops, and events on a wide array of domains such as technical, industrial, management, social development and much more.
