#LangChallenge

LangChallenge is an enthralling initiative to foster more interest and to add some thrill to the coding experience among the coding enthusiasts and the amateur coders. It is a 2-day event. Both team participation and individual participation are allowed for this challenge. A team must have 2-3 members. 

Every team will be allotted a new programming language (which will be an uncommon one) and the participants will be required to learn that new language within the allotted time and also complete a set of problems of 100 points each, using that programming language, that will be assigned to them. The tasks will include some basic programming questions and application-based programs. The participants will be required to put the solutions to the problems on GitHub. A small workshop will be conducted to introduce the participants to the usage of GitHub in case they are not familiar with it. There will be a final presentation near the swimming pool during the final day. The winner will be awarded with Cash Prize and goodies. 

The main objective of this challenge will be to check the ability of a person to learn something new and use it to solve real world application problems and also to encourage the youth to hone their ability in learning new skills faster.  

## LangChallenge is part of CSIS'18

The Computer Society India Symposium (CSIS) is a flagship event of the IEEE Computer Society India SAC and is held annually with the venue being rotated among the various sections of India. The main scope of this symposium is to bring professionals, speakers, experts, and other academicians so that the participants can interact with and in the process learn. The symposium is generally a 3-day event and includes talks, workshops, and events on a wide array of domains such as technical, industrial, management, social development and much more.
